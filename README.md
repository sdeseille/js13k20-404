js13kGames 2020 contest 

I'm thinking to make an shoot-em up game about [404 Maritime Patrol and Training Squadron RCAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/404_Maritime_Patrol_and_Training_Squadron)

Will see more after some more thinking.

It is difficult to me to start something with the first idea.
I have another idea more realistic to me to be able to complete.

I'm thinking to a game where player use an anti air defense to protect civilian vehicules against several type of aerial threath.

I have found a article on wikipedia about [404e régiment d’artillerie anti-aériens](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/404e_r%C3%A9giment_d%27artillerie_anti-a%C3%A9rienne)

I'm in the theme of the contest.
